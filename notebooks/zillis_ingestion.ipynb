Diabetes makes it hard for the body to heal itself, increasing the risk of wounds becoming chronic and raising the risk of infection.\\n\\nSignificantly, nonhealing diabetic ulcers result in a large number of amputations in Singapore. About two major limb amputations are carried out daily to remove lower limbs affected by diabetes-related ulcers or gangrene.\\n\\n Diabetic Ulcer Prevention\\n\\nTo reduce the risk of wounds, regular foot care is important for those with diabetes. Take these steps to reduce foot injuries and wounds:\\n\\n- Check your feet every day for red spots, cuts, swelling or blisters.\\n- Use a mirror or get help to inspect the bottom of your feet.\\n- Wash your feet every day and dry them carefully, especially between the toes.\\n- Moisturise your feet daily, ideally after washing, to keep the skin soft and smooth.\\n- Massage a thin coat of lotion over the top and bottom of your feet, but not between the toes as the skin is thinner and more prone to splitting.\\n- File away hard skin patches on the sole of the feet or toes at least once a week to prevent foot ulcers from forming underneath.\\n- Keep toenails trimmed to prevent them from cutting into your toes.\\n- Cut toenails straight across and file the edges, never into the sides as this causes ingrown nails.\\n- Always wear shoes and socks, and never walk barefoot to prevent injuries.\\n- Ensure shoes are comfortable and fit well.\\n\\nSource: HealthHub', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Food is converted into glucose before it is absorbed into our bloodstream. The function of insulin is to move the glucose from the bloodstream into the body cells for use or storage. People with diabetes are unable to fully use the glucose in their bloodstream either because they lack insulin in the body or insulin is ineffective for them.\\n\\n Insulin Therapy\\n\\nTreatment for type 1 diabetes involves dietary control and insulin injections. Some patients with type 2 diabetes may also require insulin injections. Insulin is not effective if taken by mouth, and has to be injected.\\n\\n You must know how to:\\n\\n- Measure your insulin dose\\n- Inject yourself (and not rely on others)\\n- Adapt your diet and activity to your insulin injections\\n\\n Types of Insulin\\n\\nThere are several types of insulin. They differ in how quickly they start to lower your blood glucose, the time taken to reach their highest activity, and how long they continue to work.\\n\\n How to Inject Insulin\\n\\nKnowing where to inject your insulin will make the injection easier, safer and more comfortable.

It is not a good idea to change injection areas frequently. This may cause your blood sugar levels to go up and down. This happens because insulin moves into blood at different speeds from different areas.\\n\\nYou should inject your insulin into a different spot each time. Injecting into the same spot often may lead to formation of thick areas under the skin. Insulin injected into these areas may not be absorbed well. Rotating your insulin injection spot will prevent these thick areas from forming. You should try and use each spot only once a month.\\n\\nCheck your injection areas every few days. You can press gently and run your fingertips across each area. If there are any lumps, painful spots or any change of colour in the area, report these to your diabetes care team. Avoid using these areas until the problem stops.\\n\\n Timing of Insulin Injections\\n\\nInject your insulin 30 minutes before meals. The insulin will move into your blood to match the rise in the blood sugar level. You should eat regularly throughout the day. This is to avoid a low blood sugar levels caused by the injected insulin.\\n\\nIf you are using a new insulin called Lispro Insulin (Humalog®) you do not have to wait 30 minutes before eating your meal.

Between uses, replace the cap and put the syringe in the fridge.\\n\\n Insulin Pens\\n\\nInsulin pens combine both the needle and insulin cartridge into one. Thus, insulin injections become more convenient and you do not have to carry syringes and insulin bottles with you.\\n\\n Insulin Pumps\\n\\nThe insulin pump is a small computerised device that pumps insulin continuously through a fine plastic tube into a site under the skin 24 hours a day. It is just a little larger than a pocket pager.\\n\\nPump users have to monitor their blood sugar frequently so as to make adjustments to the amount of insulin delivered. The insulin pump generally gives you better control and more meal flexibility, but is costlier and requires more frequent blood sugar monitoring.\\n\\n Switching to Insulin from Anti-diabetes Tablets\\n\\nPatients who are switched to insulin from anti-diabetes tablets often worry that their condition must be deteriorating. However, the switch to insulin was made because the diabetes was getting out of control as the tablets were failing to control the patient’s blood sugar — and the insulin will correct that.\\n\\n Insulin Side Effects\\n\\nTaking insulin may result in some side effects. These include:\\n\\n- Low blood sugar\\n- Initial weight gain\\n- Lumpy or scarred tissue from too many injections on the same part of the body\\n- Rashes on the injection site or, in rare cases, all over the body\\n\\nRead these next:\\n\\nhttps://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/diabetes-treatment-insulin', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
