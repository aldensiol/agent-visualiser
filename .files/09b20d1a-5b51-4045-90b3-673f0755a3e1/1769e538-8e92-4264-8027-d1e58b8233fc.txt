 Managing pre-diabetes

First Published: 3 July 2017

Last updated: 27 July 2021

 Key messages

1. Pre-diabetes is asymptomatic but puts a person at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
2. Early diagnosis, appropriate management and follow-up help to prevent or delay T2DM in persons with pre-diabetes.
3. Recommend lifestyle intervention to all persons with pre-diabetes.
4. Tailor lifestyle intervention to individual needs for sustained behavioural changes.
5. Consider metformin for persons with pre-diabetes when:
- glycaemic status does not improve despite lifestyle intervention OR
- they are unable to adopt lifestyle intervention, especially if persons outlined in the two points above have a body mass index (BMI) of â‰¥ 23 kg/m2, are younger than 60 years of age, or are women with a history of gestational diabetes.

 Preventing or delaying the progression to T2DM

Pre-diabetes is defined by glycaemic levels that are higher than normal, but lower than diabetes thresholds. Pre-diabetes is asymptomatic but predisposes individuals to T2DM and CVD. Around 14% of Singaporeans have impaired glucose tolerance and without lifestyle changes, at least 35% of persons with pre-diabetes in Singapore will progress to T2DM within eight years.1,2 There is a pressing need to address pre-diabetes as part of the efforts to reduce the impact of T2DM and CVD.

Education increases awareness of pre-diabetes and enables individuals to adopt lifestyle changes.

 Are Anti-diabetes Tablets Addictive?

You can never become addicted to anti-diabetes tablets. This is a common misconception among patients who do not like the idea of taking medication long-term.

The right way to think about diabetes medications is this: the tablets are there to do a job. If you take tablets only three days of the week instead of every day as instructed, you can expect your blood sugar to be high on the four days that you do not take the tablets.

Anti-diabetes tablets are meant to help keep you well. However, they won't work unless you take them.
