 Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus: Tablets

Treatment of type 2 diabetes begins with diet control. If diet alone is unable to control blood sugar levels, then tablets have to be taken. If both diet and tablets fail to control the blood sugar levels, insulin injections may be needed.

Oral anti-diabetes tablets are used for treating type 2 diabetes.

- Do not take more or less than what your doctor ordered.

- Take your tablet(s) even when you are sick (sometimes the dosage may have to be changed, so do consult your doctor beforehand).
- Follow your meal plan. It will help your tablet(s) work better. Careless eating may cause the tablet(s) to lose their effect.
